# MVC_OOD_Project
## Overview:

This project design and build a system for keep a record of all monkeys in Primate Sanctuary following the MVC architecture guidelines.

## Features:

- Register new monkeys into the sanctuary
- Move to the right enclosure monkeys that have received medical attention
- Produce a list for every enclosure. Each enclosure list shows each individual monkey that is currently housed there (for each monkey, include their name, sex, and favourite food)
- Produce an alphabetical list (by name) of all monkeys that are currently housed in the sanctuary
- Move monkeys who need medical attention to isolation area

## How to run:

- Open the JAR file
- Follow the instructions on the screen
- Click on the buttons to perform the actions

## Original design:

- The Sanctuary consists of two different types of housing:

    - Isolation is used to keep monkeys when they first arrive at the sanctuary and anytime they are receiving medical attention. Isolation consists of a series of cages each of which can house a single animal.
    - Enclosures are much larger and can host a single troop (i.e., a group) of monkeys. Each troop consists of a single species that is found in the New World (some of which are pictured below): drill, guereza, howler, mangabey, saki, spider, squirrel, and tamarin.
- Each enclosure is configured to house a particular species of monkeys.
  Monkeys that are received by the sanctuary must first go into isolation. At this time, each individual monkey is given a name, a species designation, a sex, a size, a weight, an approximate age, and a favorite food. The choices of favorite food include eggs, fruits, insects, leaves, nuts, seeds, and tree sap.
  Monkeys that have received medical attention may be moved to an enclosure.

## Assumptions:

- The system allow to register monkeys with the same name

## Limitations:

- The system does not show the monkeys that are in the isolation area
